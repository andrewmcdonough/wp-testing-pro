We’re super excited today to announce at DockerCon 2018 our collaboration with IBM to support the Sysdig Cloud-Native Intelligence Platform in IBM Cloud. Sysdig solutions on IBM Cloud will enable developer teams to easily develop, deploy, and secure cloud-native apps, as well as existing workloads moving to cloud and hybrid cloud architectures.

IBM is making significant advancements to deliver a cloud best designed for new workloads in AI, machine learning and IoT. With it’s launch of the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service][1], IBM provides developers the broadest and easiest range of ways to build with, scale and run containers. IBM is well aware of the benefits of fueling AI with containers – their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watson</a> services run on Kubernetes!

## **Simplification, speed and security for IBM Cloud**

Our collaboration has been driven at a grass roots level by developers organically realizing the benefits of Sysdig cloud-native intelligence technologies on top of IBM Cloud. Cloud architectures can be complex. Even more so when they include more than one cloud. Cloud environments are built with a lot of moving parts. Orchestrated containers and microservices automate much of the cloud equation, but make securing, monitoring, and operating apps in production a lot more complex. It’s Sysdig’s mission to make it a lot easier.

*   <a href="https://sysdigrp2rs.wpengine.com/product/monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sysdig Monitor</a> simplifies data collection for increased insight and faster incident resolution.

Everything we do helps enterprises moving not just to a cloud, but to cross-cloud infrastructures. Together with IBM, we’re able to help users eliminate concerns around security, scale and infrastructure – things that distract developers from focusing on improving their code.

The team at IBM is also very focused on expanding ease-of-use and flexibility for cross-cloud infrastructure. This week IBM made announcements that show their commitment to leadership in this space. The first announced announced a major expansion of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2018/06/10/ibm-expands-cloud-global-availability-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 new availability zones across North America, Europe and Asia</a>. The second announced the availability of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2018/06/11/cloud-for-ai-kubernetes-devops-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-zone clusters for their IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service</a>. *What do multi-zone clusters make possible?* They let users deploy a single containerized app across multiple global IBM Cloud regions. The IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service manages every piece of a containerized app simultaneously across different geographies with the assurance that each will experience the same consistent experience.

## **A look at the future with Sysdig and IBM**

So what does the future of this collaboration hold? IBM and Sysdig will work together to bring cloud-native intelligence capabilities to IBM Cloud developers. This includes expanding the set of tools available to help better orchestrate and manage cloud-native workloads and providing in-depth visibility and security for IBM Cloud integrated services like <a href="https://sysdigrp2rs.wpengine.com/blog/monitor-istio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Istio</a>.   
  
As our founder and CTO, Loris Degioanni put it, "We’re proud to partner with IBM to soon bring the monitoring, security, and forensics capabilities of the Sysdig Cloud-Native Intelligence Platform deeper into the IBM Cloud. With our joint plans to deeply integrate the two offerings, our goal is to provide customers with seamless cloud-native security and monitoring on top of IBM Cloud’s already-powerful capabilities."   
  
Watch this space - we’re just getting started!
