Its that time of year again, <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/index.html" target="_blank">AWS re:Invent</a> is just around the corner! AWS re:Invent is the industry’s premier cloud computing event, attracting more than 15,000 developers, operations, and IT business decision makers from around the globe. This year’s event will be taking place from **October 6-9** at **The Venetian in Las Vegas, NV**. With over 250 sessions planned covering cloud architecture, continuous deployment, monitoring and management, performance, security, migration, and more - this is shaping up to be the best re:Invent yet! 

  
We’re sponsoring re:Invent for a second straight year, so if you are planning on attending, we’d love to say hi! We’ll be at **Booth #1339** where we will be giving demos of our container-native monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting solution called <a href="https://sysdigrp2rs.wpengine.com/" target="_blank">Sysdig Cloud</a>. Sysdig Cloud provides unprecedented application-level visibility inside containers without needing any additional configuration or agents. With our microservice-friendly architecture, you just drop the Sysdig Cloud container into your environment, and we'll automatically see deep inside the rest of your containers and your microservice-based environment.

So if you are testing containers, actively using containers in dev environments, or already have containers fully deployed in production, you should definitely swing by **Booth #1339** to get a demo of the first and only container-native monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting solution on the market. Plus you can pick up a free t-shirt to help with your Vegas wardrobe! We promise you haven’t seen container visibility like this before!
