If you haven’t already heard, we’re holding our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Sysdig-San-Francisco/events/222511866/" target="_blank">next meetup</a> on June 2nd at the PagerDuty headquarters in downtown San Francisco. We’re unveiling our new, open source curses UI that we’re calling csysdig and providing a sneak peek before we release it to the public. We’d love for you to join us for this special event if you happen to be in the area. It’ll be jam packed with informative content and be a great networking opportunity. 



Here’s an overview of the content we’ll be covering: 

## 6:00pm - Registration & happy hour 

Sign in, grab your sysdig schwag, and enjoy some delicious food and cold beverages. 

## 6:45pm - Container troubleshooting use cases 

Containers are a hot topic these days, but most open-source tools providing visibility into containers are limited in scope. During this talk we’ll leverage csysdig’s powerful container visibility to walk through some interesting container troubleshooting use cases that will make managing your containerized infrastructure a whole lot easier. 

## 7:05pm - csysdig overview and architecture 

In this talk, the author will present an overview of csysdig and show how it works under the hood. If understanding the inner-workings of an awesome system troubleshooting tool like csysdig sounds interesting to you, this will be a can’t-miss session. 

## 7:20pm - How to write your own csysdig tutorial 

We’ll wrap the presentations up with a tutorial on how you can create your own csysdig views and contribute to the open source project. You’ll walk away with everything you need to know to start contributing and get involved with the sysdig community. 

## 7:40pm - Q&A 

Join the presenters, several members of the Sysdig team, and other attendees after the event to discuss the presentations, container technologies, and network with other members of the sysdig community! 

To reserve your spot at the meetup, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Sysdig-San-Francisco/events/222511866/" target="_blank">register here</a>. On behalf of the entire Sysdig team, we look forward to seeing you on June 2nd and getting your feedback on csysdig!
