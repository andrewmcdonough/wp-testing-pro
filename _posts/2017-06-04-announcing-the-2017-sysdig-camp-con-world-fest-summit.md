<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m excited to announce that </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sysdig Camp-Con-World-Fest-Summit</span>][1]<span style="font-weight: 400;"> (called CCWFS for those in the know) is back for its second year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">attended last year’s event</span>][2]<span style="font-weight: 400;">, you know this is the premier event if you want to get down-and-deep into the container world. Given our roots in deep linux and container troubleshooting, it should come as no surprise to you that we’re creating an event that is light on fluff, and heavy on CLI, workshops, and product demonstrations.</span>

*<span style="font-weight: 400;">You might remember this great talk from last year’s event: How to Reconstruct a Compromised Binary Using Sysdig.</span>*

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our theme of the event is: </span>**Containers in operation**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. To us, that means bringing together some of the best information possible on managing, monitoring, troubleshooting, and securing containers in the wild.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we’ll be expanding both the topics covered in the conference as well as the presence of the container ecosystem. Expect to see some amazing speakers from leading container platforms… and also some surprises! (wink, wink… more to come on this.)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, our confirmed speakers are from Sysdig (of course!). We’d love you to</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;"> submit a proposal</span>][1]<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and join the event! We are striving to have an event that is interesting and diverse on all levels.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, <a href="https://sysdigccwfs2017.eventbrite.com/">early bird registration is now live</a>! There are a limited number of early bird seats, so when they are gone they are gone. Register right now!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can’t wait to see you at the event.</span>
