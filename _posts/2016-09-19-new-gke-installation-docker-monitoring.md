Stuff just takes...too...long these days. How long should you wait, for example , to monitor your docker containers on GKE? “Too long” is the answer you get most places.

That’s why we just launched our new, super-sleek, telsa-would-be-impressed-at-how-fast-this-is Google Container Engine integration. 

How does it work? Just sign in with Google single-sign on, authorize Sysdig to get your pertinent info, and choose a GKE project and cluster. And, that’s pretty much it!

Seriously. Even if you don’t have a Sysdig Cloud account, we’ll create one for you at this point. From there we’ll instrument the system, get the relevant Kubernetes metadata, and you’re off to the races!
