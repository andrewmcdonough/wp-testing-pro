We’ve been hard at work here at Sysdig building native monitoring and visibility support for Kubernetes. In earlier blog posts Gianluca Borello, a Sysdig core contributor, covered <a href="https://sysdigrp2rs.wpengine.com/sysdigkubernetes-adventure-part-1-kubernetes-services-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digging Into</a> and <a href="https://sysdigrp2rs.wpengine.com/a-sysdigkubernetes-adventure-part-2-troubleshooting-kubernetes-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troubleshooting</a> Kubernetes deployments with Sysdig. Recently at KubeCon, Gianluca had the opportunity to present to a full house and demonstrate a live, in-depth exploration of an actual Kubernetes environment. It’s not too often that command line tool demos get spontaneous applause, so I’d have to say the audience seemed impressed :)   
  
If you’re already a Kubernetes user, or just interested in learning how you might get more out of a Kubernetes environment with less effort, I’m confident you’ll find this 20 min video worthwhile:
