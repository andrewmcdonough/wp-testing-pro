We make it a point to talk to people about [sysdig][1] every day. One of the most common reactions we get from new users is, “wow, that was easy!” People seem surprised at how quickly they are up and running on sysdig and getting value from the tool. I know in my own experience, I’ll often put off diving into new system tools because I expect there will be a day of configuration and trial and error before anything really interesting happens. We designed sysdig to avoid that problem. Here's a [short video][2] on how to [install sysdig][3] and start exploring your system in **under three minutes**. And if you’d like even more inspiration to get started with sysdig, check out this whole page of [useful sysdig one-liners][4]. <div style="margin: 50px 0 0 0;" align="center">
