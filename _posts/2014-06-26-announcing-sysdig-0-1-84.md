We're pleased to announce the release of Sysdig 0.1.84. This release brings a couple of cool enhancements: support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 in the installer and improvements to the set of chisels that track the commands executed by users. A new post showing how to use the new chisels is coming soon, so stay tuned!
