The highlight of this release is the ability to expose sysdigâ€™s process table through the Lua interface. Three new chisels have been added that leverage this functionality: 
*   <tt>lsof</tt>
*   <tt>ps</tt>
*   <tt>netstat</tt>Following the tradition, a blog post describing this new functionality will be coming very soon.
