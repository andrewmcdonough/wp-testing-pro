It's almost time for AWS re:Invent 2014! The sold-out conference is taking place this week, November 11-14, at The Venetian in Las Vegas, NV, and we're excited to be sponsors for the show.  
  
If you're going to be there, I hope you'll come by our booth (#730) and meet the team. We're really looking forward to meeting you, the global sysdig community, face to face. Our founder/CEO and creator of sysdig, Loris Degioanni, will be there giving presentations on beginner and advanced usage of sysdig. Our top engineers will be talking through some of sysdig's most popular blog posts and use cases. And of course there will be plenty of awesome sysdig swag, like tshirts, stickers, and [this handy sysdig cheatsheet][2]. You can always print off your own copy, but wouldn't you rather come get one hand-delivered by me??  
  
We'll also be showing off Sysdig Cloud publicly for the first time ever! <span>Sysdig Cloud is our SaaS monitoring and troubleshooting solution, based on sysdig technology, and designed from the ground up for the modern operations team. </span>If you're interested in seeing what the future of infrastructure performance management looks like, then stop by the booth and get a demo. We'd love to get your thoughts and feedback.  
  
And for the record, here are some of the topics that Loris and the engineering team will be presenting from our booth throughout the week:
