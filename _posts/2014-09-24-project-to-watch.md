Today, the Linux Foundation’s linux.com website published an article entitled [5 New Enterprise Open Source Projects to Watch][1]. 
Sysdig is number two on the list!

I thought I'd take this moment to share a couple quick thoughts.

Number one:** Thank you.**

Sysdig was released less than 6 months ago, and it’s amazing how fast it’s spreading. It is uniquely gratifying to be working on a tool that people seem to love, and recognition like today's makes me and the sysdig team proud. More importantly, we know that this couldn’t have happened without the support of our early users and contributors, so thanks!

Number two: Don’t think for a minute that we’re slowing down or resting on our laurels. We want to make sysdig the world’s definitive troubleshooting tool. We know it’s a very ambitious goal, and we’re working at it as hard as we can.

So I hope you will take linux.com's advice and keep "watching" sysdig, because even cooler stuff is coming soon, I promise. Here's a teaser ;)
