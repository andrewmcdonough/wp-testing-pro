Here at Sysdig, we keep talking about how containers and microservices represent a fundamental sea change in how applications will be architected, deployed, maintained, and scaled. And when you go through a platform shift like this - similar to the shift from bare metal to VMs - the new platform demands a new ecosystem of tools. This is the only way to get the full benefit of a core new technology: corresponding technology that has been built from the ground up to complement the new platform. 

  
Today I am proud to announce a new validation of our vision: EMA has selected Sysdig as a “Vendor to Watch” based on our “innovative approach to container visibility.” 

  
According to Dan Twing, President and COO at Enterprise Management Associates: “Sysdig’s architecture and deployment model is closely aligned with the way enterprises are using and deploying microservice-based architectures. As the use of container technologies in the enterprise continues to rise, organizations will need monitoring and management tools that can see into and understand containers as well as the rest of the environment. Container-native monitoring solutions like Sysdig will enable companies to deploy them into production with confidence.”
